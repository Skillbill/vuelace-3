[Vuelace-3](https://www.github.com/Skillbill/vuelace-3) is a UI component library for Vue,
built on top of [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) and [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/).

The scope was to have a friendly components wrapper for the Shoelace web components ready to use in Vue.
We also included some utilities to use icons comfortably and fulfill missing components with PrimeVue's ones.
